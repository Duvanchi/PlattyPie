		What is the platypus?  Where did it come form?  Why would nature create such a strange amalgamation of seemingly unrelated animal parts?  Who knows?  Who cares?

		Don't be fooled, these little guys are awesome.  I mean, mammals that lay eggs and have the mouth of a waterfowl!  What's not to love.  Well, alot actually.  Not really, now I'm just wasting time.  Blah blah, playpus, blah blah blah.
